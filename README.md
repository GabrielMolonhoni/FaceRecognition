## 1. Objective

Solve a face recognition problem using neural networks. Given an image of a person's face, your model must correctly identify whose face it is (out of 83 possible people).

## 2. Dataset
For model development, we considered the PubFig83 dataset. The available dataset contains the following specifications:

* Color images of the faces of 83 artists, totaling 13,840 images extracted from the Internet.
* All images were previously resized to 100x100 pixels, having been aligned according to the position of the people's eyes.
